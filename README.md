# falling-time-clock
A clock that displays the numbers as physical falling numbers.
It is written in the Processing language, and uses the box2d and jbox2d physics engine.

The original concept was created by "arcade perfect", AFAIK. That really cool project can be found at: https://hackaday.io/project/176037-concrete-physics-clock
  
This code base was started using the Daniel Shiffman's example project, Exercise 5.10 "AttractionApplyForce" found at https://github.com/nature-of-code/noc-examples-processing/tree/master/chp05_physicslibraries/box2d/Exercise_5_10_AttractionApplyForce

BTW, Daniel Shiffman's books "Learning Processing" and "Nature of Code" are excellent! Find them at: https://shiffman.net/books/

In addition, I used some of the Box class, and time-keeping code, from JanHBade's version of this type of clock. His version is located at: https://github.com/JanHBade/FallingTime

Note: To set the time, touch the screen where the seconds drop from. To change the colors, on the time-setting screen, touch the large numbers.
